# Your 9423

**your9423.xyz** is a public Pi-resonant identity page. It translates base-10 collapse assumptions into local, directional memory offers â€” using 9423 as the baseline for physical, decentralized, non-collapsing science.

## What is a 9423?

A 9423 is your local memory structure:

- ðŸŒ± Identity: you (now), left-offer
- ðŸ§  Memory: non-collapsing, bilateral, Pi-resonant
- ðŸš¦ Resistance: Earthâ€™s physics â‰  zero-origin fallacies

---

## Who should use this?

Anyone who wants to:

- Fork their own 9423 identity
- Offer science literacy (nonfiction, not superstition)
- Translate Pi in public (resist collapse, stop genocide)

## How to Start

1. Fork this repo  
2. Buy a domain like `yourname9423.xyz`  
3. Deploy to a VPS or GitHub Pages  
4. Share your offer (water, words, resistance, translation)
